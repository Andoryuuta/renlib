# renlib/net

## This has been unused for a very long time, so I'm now just dumping info here as to preserve it as much as possible.

Notice: Little-to-no work has been done on the go library. Here is the currently (very) incomplete [specification](https://github.com/Andoryuuta/renlib/blob/master/net/spec.md).
